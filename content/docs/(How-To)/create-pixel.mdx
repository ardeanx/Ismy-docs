## Pixel Purpose

You might wondering, what is the purpose or benefits by using Pixel Tracking. Here is why:

- Performance Tracking
- Retargeting & Behavioral Advertising
- Conversion Tracking

### How does it worked?

1. A tracking pixel URL is generated by the analytics or ad platform.
2. The pixel image (usually 1x1 transparent GIF or PNG) is placed in the webpage, ad, or email.
3. When a user loads the page or opens an email, the browser requests the image from the server.
4. The server logs user activity, which is then analyzed for marketing insights.
